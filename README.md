Tray application that stores the user activity, basically showing a history of when the user were active at the computer
and when he was not.

Also shows a popup if the users works continuously for 20 minutes telling him to take a break. 
This is mainly since I have a back problem I need to move around every 20 minutes :)


Planned features
----------------

Menu shows each repo with status, inc. when last push was (global scope).
